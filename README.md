## 🚀 RFID-DETECTIVE Development Tasklist

This repository contains the core development roadmap for the **RFID-DETECTIVE** project —  
a **portable RFID reader and analyzer** built by **RRG (RFID Research Group)**.  
The system supports both **HF (13.56 MHz)** and **LF (125 kHz)** card reading,  
with on-board password handling for **MIFARE Classic 1K** cards and a minimal user interface.

Developers and engineers can review and contribute to the four primary functions listed below.  
*(All prices are indicative and open to discussion based on deliverables and expertise.)*

### 🧩 Core Functional Modules

| # | Function / Feature | Description | Est. Price (USD) |
|:-:|--------------------|--------------|-----------------:|
| 1 | 🔌 **HF Card Reading Support** | Implement reading of various high-frequency (13.56 MHz) cards — e.g., MIFARE Classic 1K/4K, NTAG, DESFire, ISO14443-A/B. | **$150** |
| 2 | 📡 **LF Card Reading Support** | Add support for low-frequency (125 kHz) cards — e.g., EM4100, T5577, HID Prox. | **$130** |
| 3 | 🔐 **MIFARE Classic 1K Password Handling** | Integrate Key A / Key B authentication for MIFARE Classic 1K cards and enable secure sector data access. | **$100** |
| 4 | 🖥️ **MVP User Interface** | Develop a simple on-device interface (OLED/LCD) to display card UID, type, and status. | **$120** |

💰 **Total Estimated Budget:** ≈ **$500**
